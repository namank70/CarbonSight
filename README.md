# 🌍 CarbonSight

## Prototype Disclaimer

- CarbonSight is a hackathon prototype created for demonstration purposes.
- The data and outputs in this repository are illustrative and should not be interpreted as audited real-world analysis or production-ready decision support.


## 🚀 AI-Powered Supply Chain Carbon Intelligence Platform

---

## 1. Project Overview

CarbonSight is an AI-assisted carbon footprint estimation platform for product supply chains.

It predicts **per-unit CO₂ emissions** and recommends **realistic greener alternatives** based on:

- Route & transport mode  
- Material composition  
- Manufacturing energy intensity  
- Packaging type  
- Recycled content  

### Architecture Stack

CarbonSight combines:

- FastAPI backend  
- Random Forest ML model  
- React + Vite frontend  
- CSV-driven environmental datasets  

---

## 2. Core Objective

CarbonSight helps users compare:

- **Original Carbon Footprint**
- **Greener Optimized Footprint**
- **Estimated Reduction Percentage**
- **Actionable Emission Reduction Suggestions**

### Carbon Tax Simulation Layer

CarbonSight also adds an economics intelligence layer:

- Simulated $100/ton carbon pricing  
- Baseline cost exposure  
- Greener scenario cost exposure  
- Estimated tax savings per unit  

This transforms sustainability from measurement-only → financial decision support.

## 5. End-to-End Workflow

Step 1: Frontend loads metadata from backend  
(materials, countries, presets, routes, options)

Step 2: User selects:
- Product category  
- Materials  
- Route  
- Manufacturing country  
- Packaging  

Step 3: Backend:
- Normalizes inputs
- Applies route & category constraints
- Validates feasibility

Step 4: ML model predicts original per-unit CO₂.

Step 5: Optimization engine searches valid lower-carbon alternatives.

Step 6: Backend returns:
- Original CO₂
- Greener CO₂
- Reduction %
- Suggested changes
- Emission breakdown
- Score & grade
- Carbon risk level

Step 7: Frontend renders:
- Interactive result cards
- Visual comparison
- Savings metrics

## 6. Setup & Run

### Safe Local Setup

This project is safest to run in an isolated local environment:

- Use a Python virtual environment for the backend
- Keep frontend dependencies inside this repo with `npm install`
- Do not install backend packages globally

### Backend

From the repo root:

```powershell
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload --host localhost --port 8000
```

### Frontend

Open a second terminal:

```powershell
cd frontend
npm install
```

Optional `.env` file in `frontend/`:

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

If no `.env` file is set, the frontend defaults to `http://localhost:8000`.

Run development server:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

### Optional Frontend Build

```powershell
cd frontend
npm run build
```

## 9. Notes & Assumptions

- CarbonSight is a hackathon prototype created for demonstration purposes.
- The data and outputs in this repository are illustrative and should not be interpreted as audited real-world analysis or production-ready decision support.
- Emission breakdown is a scaled explainability proxy.
- Includes manufacturing, packaging, and transport.
- Excludes use-phase and end-of-life emissions.
- Data is CSV-based for demo speed and transparency.
